# Oral Disease Classification Task

## üìù Overview  
This repository contains the implementation of an **Oral Disease Classification Model** designed to classify oral diseases from a single image. The project leverages advanced image preprocessing techniques and state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify oral health conditions (e.g., healthy, dental caries, gingivitis, etc.).

The model is built to handle diverse real-world challenges, including:  
- Variations in image quality  
- Different lighting conditions  
- Multiple image orientations  

## üöÄ Features  
- **Accurate Disease Prediction**: Identifies a single disease class per image.  
- **Robust Image Processing**: Handles real-world variations in input data.  
- **Customizable Framework**: Easily adaptable to different ML frameworks and datasets.  
- **AI-Driven Development**: Built with the assistance of AI wrappers, showcasing how artificial intelligence can streamline the development process.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:  
  - OpenCV (Image Preprocessing)  
  - TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (Deep Learning)  
  - Custom AI Wrappers (Development Optimization)  

## ü§ñ AI in Action  
This project demonstrates how AI can enhance development by:  
1. **Accelerating Code Generation**: Leveraging AI tools for boilerplate code and model creation.  
2. **Streamlining Troubleshooting**: Using AI to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.  
3. **Improving Model Optimization**: Integrating AI-generated suggestions for hyperparameter tuning and architecture improvements.  

By utilizing AI wrappers and tools, this project not only simplifies the creation of complex models but also highlights the potential of AI to augment human creativity and problem-solving in machine learning workflows.
